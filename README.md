# iText for Apple Watch

iText was an iOS app that uploaded a written text from iPhone to an Apple Watch. 

All the usage was offline, the user could choose between three different sections to put text in; once the String was uploaded on the Apple Watch, the notes could be accessed everywhere even when the phone was turned off. 
A new feature was added in the latest releases: the emergency button. 

If you were reading your notes and someone tried to spy on them you could easily just press the emergency button and a (customizable) Watch Face was shown on the screen to prevent everyone from reading your private notes.
